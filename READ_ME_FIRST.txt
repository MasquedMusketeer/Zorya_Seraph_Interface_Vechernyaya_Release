Zorya Seraph Interface ver 0.2.1 alpha 		Vechernyaya Release

Features:

-she can recognize a few lines of dialogue
-she can react to runtime shinenigans
-she can and will mock you
-and she currently has a framework that enables users to customize actions (though not very straightfoward)

how to use:

as of now, you HAVE to install python to run Zorya,
just open cmd by:

press ctrl + r
type cmd
write python
windows will open the microssoft store, just click install

Zorya also uses an external library to play voiced lines, but she installs it during runtime.

after installing python, just run Zorya.bat from the main folder, and voila.

since i want to expand her intent recognition spontaineously, i wont provide what she recognizes and what she doesnt. but be sure, she will tell you if she doesnt know something.

lastly, due to some limitations, if you want to close Zorya the right way, be sure to say her name with whatever other line you say.
for example, instead of just "goodbye" say "goodbye Zorya", otherwise she will not understand, and mock you for not typing right.


THAT'S IT, HAVE FUN, AND DON'T FORGET TO SEND ME YOUR LOGS AFTER TESTING.
